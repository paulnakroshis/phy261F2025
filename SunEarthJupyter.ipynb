    "## Background\n",
    "In class, we have looked at a simulation (with the Euler-Cromer method) of the Earth and Moon. \n",
    "It turns out (those of you who have had Phy 331 will have seen this) that the two body system can be \n",
    "solved exactly. However, once you get to *three* bodies, there are very few analytical solutions; in general there is no analytical solution that covers all cases. In fact, the *n-body* problem is *the* problem in celestial mechanics, and we have to study it by simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I'm asking you to simulate the Sun-Earth-Jupyter system. This is question 4.16 in Giordano's book, so the handout I gave you is a good reference. Here is the statement of the question:\n",

    "### Problem 4.16\n",
    "Carry out a true three body simulation in which the motions of Earth, Jupyter, and the Sun are all calculated.\n",
    "Since all three bodies are now in motion, it is useful to take the center of mass of the three body system as the origin, rather that the position of the sun. We also suggest that you give the Sun an initial velocity which makes the total momentum of the system exactly zero (so that the center of mass of the system remains fixed.)\n",
    "Here are the current positions of all three objects: ( you should check that the total momentum is zero)\n",
    "\n",
    "**SUN:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Position (x, y) = (+1.911569×10⁸, -7.157680×10⁸) meters\n",
    "\n",
    "Velocity (vx, vy) = (+12.26454, +2.583911) m/s\n",
    "\n",
    "**EARTH:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Position (x, y) = (+9.232303×10¹⁰, +1.151341×10¹¹) meters\n",

    "#### Part 1 (10 pts)\n",
    "Verify that the initial conditions above work, and if not, fix them. Compute the initial energy of the system. Recall that the total energy of the system will the the sum of the kinetic energies and the potential energies of interaction (there are three of each type of term.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 2 (10 pts)\n",
    "Simulate the three body system using the Euler-Cromer method.\n",
    "Plot the trajectories for at least one Jupyter year. You should be able to re-create figure 4.12.\n",
    "Also plot the total system energy as a function of time to make sure everything is working correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 3 (5 pts)\n",
    "Now increase the mass of Jupyter to 10, 100, and 1000 times it's normal mass (you'll have to modify the initial velocity of the Sun to make the total momentum of the system to be zero.). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extra Credit (10 pts)\n",
    "Add code that produces an realtime plot of the system. "
